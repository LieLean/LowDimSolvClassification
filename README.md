# LowDimSolvClassification

This is an open-source project that formalizes in the Lean theorem prover the classification of solvable Lie algebras of dimension zero to three, over (as) arbitrary fields (as we can), using [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

The main theorems are in the folder [Lie](Lie).

Part of the project involves the formalization of general properties of Lie algebras, their derived series and other Lie-theoretic results.
